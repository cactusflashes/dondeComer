# dondeComer

shouldwefood.xyz is a web project that I created in a weekend half-drunk & baked, watching Mirai, eating Chili's and above all else, vibing out. 

This was a website that I wanted to make to practice my front-end skills and help our work group pick a resturaunt to eat lunch at, since we're not super great at making decisions as a group.
